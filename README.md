# compare_calenders
my attempt at a google coding interview given by ClÃ©ment Mihailescu - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Q_oYDQ2whs

my first attempt:
  passing each calender array to availableDays() function ruturns a new array of possible times within the calender boundary.  
  You then simply filter both returned possible times for the free slots available for a meeting. 
 
 ```javascript
 The availableDays() has a time complexity of O(n). 
 The getFreeSlots() has a time complexity of o(n^2)
      since with each iteration n of array a, we're comparing against all n of array b.
       return aPossible.filter( each => bPossible.includes( each ));
              // filter - O(n)
                 // includes - O(n)
              = O( n * n ) || O(n^2).
```
