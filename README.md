# compare_calenders
my attempt at a google coding interview given by Cl√©ment Mihailescu - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Q_oYDQ2whs

my first attempt:
  passing each calender array to availableDays() function ruturns a new array of possible times within the calender boundary.  
  You then simply filter both returned possible times for the free slots available for a meeting. Overall this attempt has a time   
  complexity of O(n).
